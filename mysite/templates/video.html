  <h4>Evaluating Image Localization algorithm</h4>
When we build machine learning models for the real world, we are required to evaluate such models to check their performance on unseen data points.
<br> With the same intention in mind, we rely on an evaluation metric to check the effectiveness of different models on real-world data points.
 <br> For the Image localization task, IoU is the widely used evaluation metrics. IoU stands for Intersection over Union.
<br>
To calculate IoU, we consider both the ground truth bounding box and the predicted bounding box.
